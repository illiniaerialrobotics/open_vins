Welcome to the OpenVINS project!
The OpenVINS project houses some core computer vision code along with a state-of-the art filter-based visual-inertial
estimator. The core filter is an [Extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) which
fuses inertial information with sparse visual feature tracks. These visual feature tracks are fused leveraging
the [Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642) sliding window
formulation which allows for 3D features to update the state estimate without directly estimating the feature states in
the filter. Inspired by graph-based optimization systems, the included filter has modularity allowing for convenient
covariance management with a proper type-based state system. Please take a look at the feature list below for full
details on what the system supports.

## Codebase Extensions

* **[ov_plane](https://github.com/rpng/ov_plane)** - A real-time monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system which leverages
  environmental planes. At the core it presents an efficient robust monocular-based plane detection algorithm which does
  not require additional sensing modalities such as a stereo, depth camera or neural network. The plane detection and tracking
  algorithm enables real-time regularization of point features to environmental planes which are either maintained in the state
  vector as long-lived planes, or marginalized for efficiency. Planar regularities are applied to both in-state SLAM and
  out-of-state MSCKF point features, enabling long-term point-to-plane loop-closures due to the large spacial volume of planes.

* **[vicon2gt](https://github.com/rpng/vicon2gt)** - This utility was created to generate groundtruth trajectories using
  a motion capture system (e.g. Vicon or OptiTrack) for use in evaluating visual-inertial estimation systems.
  Specifically we calculate the inertial IMU state (full 15 dof) at camera frequency rate and generate a groundtruth
  trajectory similar to those provided by the EurocMav datasets. Performs fusion of inertial and motion capture
  information and estimates all unknown spacial-temporal calibrations between the two sensors.

* **[ov_maplab](https://github.com/rpng/ov_maplab)** - This codebase contains the interface wrapper for exporting
  visual-inertial runs from [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins) into the ViMap structure taken
  by [maplab](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab). The state estimates and raw images are appended to the ViMap as
  OpenVINS runs through a dataset. After completion of the dataset, features are re-extract and triangulate with
  maplab's feature system. This can be used to merge multi-session maps, or to perform a batch optimization after first
  running the data through OpenVINS. Some example have been provided along with a helper script to export trajectories
  into the standard groundtruth format.

* **[ov_secondary](https://github.com/rpng/ov_secondary)** - This is an example secondary thread which provides loop
  closure in a loosely coupled manner for [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins). This is a modification of the
  code originally developed by the HKUST aerial robotics group and can be found in
  their [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion) repository. Here we stress that this is a
  loosely coupled method, thus no information is returned to the estimator to improve the underlying OpenVINS odometry.
  This codebase has been modified in a few key areas including: exposing more loop closure parameters, subscribing to
  camera intrinsics, simplifying configuration such that only topics need to be supplied, and some tweaks to the loop
  closure detection to improve frequency.

# Installing Openvins with Realsense-ros for ROS1

## Realsense Setup

# Install librealsense-sdk from source 

  - Refer [this](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/blob/c94410a420b74e5fb6a414bd12215c05ddd82b69/doc/installation.md) to instal librealsense v2.50.0 which is the lastest compatible sdk for ros1-legacy.
  - use the cmake command `cmake ../ -DBUILD_GRAPHICAL_EXAMPLES=true -DBUILD_WITH_CUDA=true -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
  - connect camera and run `realsense-viewer` to test installation.
  - Download and extract compatible firware into the Realsense camera. The compatible FW version can be found [here](https://dev.realsenseai.com/docs/firmware-releases-d400) for our case we need Version-5_13_0_50.
  - Follow the steps [here](https://dev.realsenseai.com/docs/firmware-update-tool) to flash the camera firmware.
  - test again with `realsense-viewer`

# Calibrate camera
  - in `realsense-viewer` go to `More -> On chip calibration`. Make sure the camera is more than 30cm away facing a white wall.
  - The camera calibrates by emitting infrared dots and using it to estimate intrinsic/extrinsic parameters [see](https://www.realsenseai.com/stereo-depth/self-calibration-for-depth-cameras/).
  - To calibrate imu `pip3 install pyrealsense2` then inside librealsense run  `python3 tools/rs-imu-calibration` and follow the instructions. Use a wall+bench or camera box to hold camera steady in different orientations. For more info see [tools/rs-imu-calibration](https://github.com/realsenseai/librealsense/tree/c94410a420b74e5fb6a414bd12215c05ddd82b69/tools/rs-imu-calibration)
  - Calibrating IMU minimizes drift while using the VIO and should be repeated after any crashes
  - [calibrate using Kalibr](https://youtu.be/BtzmsuJemgI?si=j955JdZ4IapLuakd) to get intrinsics and extrinsics for Openvins. 

# Install Realsense-ros
  - You need to install the `ros1-legacy` branch of realsense-ros in your workspace using 

``` git clone https://github.com/realsenseai/realsense-ros.git -b ros1-legacy```

  - after building using `catkin build` you can test by running
```roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_camera.launch```

  - you will see rgb publishing with the default config. You need to update the launch params or provide a config to use infrared cameras and enable imu publishing. These are the required inputs to Openvins.
```
/camera/imu (200Hz linear interpolated accelrometer and gyro)
/camera/infra1/camera_info (intrinsics)
/camera/infra1/image_rect_raw (30Hz)
```
  - Important config files in `open_vins/config/rs_d435i`

```
estimator_config:         Openvins Estimator Params
imu_rs435i:               Imu calibration parameters from Kalibr
camchain-imucam-rs435i:   Imu camera extrinsics and intrinsics
rs_camera:                Realsense camera node params
```
